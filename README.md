# Classification-Clustering-Model
In this project, I utilized a Kickstarter dataset to perform two main tasks:

**Classification Model Development:**

I constructed a supervised-learning model focused on predicting the likelihood of a project's success or failure using the "state" variable as the target (categorical) variable. The model aimed to forecast whether a new project, submitted at its launch, will be successful or not. Thus, it should solely use predictors available at the project's launch time.

**Clustering Model Development:**

I created an unsupervised-learning clustering model to group Kickstarter projects based on shared characteristics. Upon finalizing the clusters, I elaborated on the distinct characteristics observed within each cluster, shedding light on the common traits or attributes that define and differentiate these project groupings.
